The Project Reflection Tool (PRT) is a conversational documentation methodology designed specifically for design research and creative work. Developed by Peter Dalsgaard and Kim Halskov, it has been adapted to support Research through Design methodologies and PhD-level academic work. It is recomended that you read these articles if you are unfamiliar with the PRT function and purpose in research as it is based directly on this work from 2012 and 2016, prior to the advent of widely available Generative AI.

# Purpose

The PRT serves dual functions in research practice:
Daily Research Journal: Captures individual work activities, decisions, and insights as they happen
Long-term Research Archive: Enables retrospective analysis of research trajectories, patterns, and methodological evolution
Rather than struggling with formal written reflection, the PRT uses a conversational structure that allows you to think through talking or stream of consciousness writing making documentation feel more natural and aligned with oral knowledge traditions.
Why Use the PRT?

# Key Benefits

Reduces cognitive load: Structured questions guide your reflection without overwhelming you
Captures tacit knowledge: Documents the “how” and “why” of your work, not just the “what”
Builds research continuity: Helps you resume work after breaks by reviewing past reflections
Supports pattern recognition: Over time, reveals methodological themes and research evolution
Creates reusable documentation: Produces well-structured artifacts for dissertations, papers, and knowledge mobilization
What the PRT Can Document

## Solo research activities
Team meetings and collaborations
Technical experimentation and testing
Reading and synthesis work
Design processes and prototyping
Unexpected discoveries and pivots
Research through design activities
How to Use the PRT

## Step 1: Initiate a PRT Session

When: After completing a significant design or research activity (ideally the same day)
Use this prompt to start your conversation with Claude:
I've just completed a design/research activity and would like to document it using our PRT Conversational Analysis process. I'm ready to reflect on this work and capture the key information following Dalsgaard and Halskov's documentation structure. Can you guide me through our template questions to help me create comprehensive documentation of this activity? After our conversation, please create a markdown artifact that I can download, with the title following this format: 'YYYY-MM-DD - [Brief descriptor of activity]' based on our conversation. Here is the template for the guided conversation.
load in template.
## Step 2: Respond to Guided Questions

Claude will guide you through six phases of reflection:
### Opening Phase
What would you title this event or activity?
When did this work take place?
### Information Gathering Phase
Who participated?
Where did it take place?
What materials, tools, or resources were used?
What was the initial goal or purpose?
### Description Phase
What happened during this event? (Key activities and steps)
Were there unexpected moments or surprises?
What artifacts were created or modified?
How did participants engage?
What methods or techniques were employed?
### Analysis & Reflection Phase
What worked well? Why was it effective?
What challenges or limitations did you encounter?
How did this connect to previous work?
Did new questions or directions emerge?
What would you do differently next time?
### Conclusion Phase
What are your key takeaways or insights?
How will these findings influence your next steps?
Did this work validate or challenge any assumptions?
What decisions were made based on this work?
### Documentation Reminder
Do you have images, videos, or documents to attach?
Are there specific quotes or observations to highlight?
## Step 3: Review and Save

Claude will summarize your conversation into a structured PRT document with the following sections:
Title: YYYY-MM-DD - [Descriptor]
Timestamp: Date and time
Information: Location, participants, resources, purpose
Description: Detailed narrative of what occurred
Conclusion: Key insights, decisions, next steps, research impact
Associated Materials: List of related files and artifacts
Download the artifact and save it in your research documentation system.
Tips for Effective PRT Documentation

## Do’s ✅

Document soon after the work: Capture details while they’re fresh
Speak naturally: Use your own voice and thinking patterns
Include failures and dead ends: These are valuable learning moments
Note connections: Reference previous work and emerging patterns
Be specific about tools and methods: This helps others replicate your process
Flag questions for follow-up: Note what needs further investigation
## Don’ts ❌

Don’t wait days or weeks: Details fade quickly
Don’t overthink your responses: The conversational format works best with natural flow
Don’t skip “negative” findings: Challenges and limitations are crucial data
Don’t assume you’ll remember: Your future self will appreciate the documentation
## File Naming Convention

Always use this syntax:
YYYY-MM-DD - Subject of the Work.md
Examples:
2025-08-17 - JSON Guardrails Test for Ojibwe Language Teacher Development.md
2025-07-28 - 360° Video Editing and AR Technology Testing at GaMaY Lab.md
2025-05-03 - Research Process Streamlining.md
## Adapting the PRT for Your Work

The PRT template is flexible. You can:
Focus on relevant questions: Not all questions apply to every activity
Add context-specific prompts: Include questions particular to your research methods
Use for retrospective analysis: Convert meeting notes or past work into PRT format
Combine with other tools: Integrate with video recording, screen capture, or field notes
