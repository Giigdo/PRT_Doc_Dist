# 2025-05-03 - Research Process Streamlining

## Timestamp
May 3, 2025

## Information
- **Location**: In-person, living room using MacBook Air
- **Participants**: Solo work
- **Resources/Tools**: 
  - MacBook Air
  - Scratch notes
  - Obsidian (including screenshot of MS Planner notes)
  - Reader notes from previous day
  - York Library website
  - Zotero with Chrome plugin
  - Claude (for creating PRT template and process)
- **Purpose/Goals**: Streamline research reading process after prolonged absence from research work due to other work constraints

## Description
This activity focused on establishing a more efficient research workflow and documentation process. The work involved reviewing previously created scratch notes and Obsidian entries, which included screenshots of MS Planner notes from the previous day. 

A significant portion of the activity involved updating bibliographic information in Zotero. The participant discovered a more efficient method for adding bibliographic information directly from the York Library website using the Zotero Chrome plugin. This eliminated the previous multi-step process of downloading references and manually importing them.

Additionally, the participant created a PRT (Project Reflection Tool) template and initiation prompt in collaboration with Claude to establish a more natural, conversation-based reflection process. The participant used voice dictation rather than typing, which aligned better with their natural thinking process.

The work emphasized keeping current research materials readily accessible rather than filed away, with "scratch files" serving as desktop references for active work.

## Analysis & Reflection
### Strengths
- The conversational PRT format felt more natural and less laborious
- The process didn't interfere with other work
- Returning to scratch notes proved effective for resuming work
- The Zotero Chrome plugin significantly improved efficiency

### Challenges
- None specifically mentioned, though there was an implied challenge of returning to research after a prolonged absence

### Connections to Previous Work
- Built upon previous practice of creating "atomic notes," though now using voice dictation rather than typing
- Modified previous organization strategy by keeping current materials front and center rather than filed away

### Emerging Questions
- No specific new directions mentioned, but increased confidence in the current approach

### Potential Improvements
- Continue refining the centralized note-keeping system for active work

## Conclusion
- **Key Insights**: The ideas developed the previous day were validated through implementation; using "scratch files" as desktop references for active work is valuable
- **Decisions Made**: Continue with the current approach for the next week before reevaluating
- **Next Steps**: Proceed with reading and design work planned for the week, advancing toward smaller projects
- **Impact on Research Trajectory**: Established a more intuitive documentation process that works with natural thinking patterns

## Associated Materials
- PRT template document (in "documenting design research activity" project)
- PRT prompt document (in "documenting design research activity" project)
- "Research Taxonomy Experiment" scratch notes
